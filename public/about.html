<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Ayan Biswas a.k.a Rakhal Chandra Ghosh currently persuing bachelors in Chemical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology,Kharagpur. I am very much passionate about building websites, solving problems and product management. My hobbies
  include photography and practicing spirituality. I have a vision about changing lives of million youths by teaching them the art of earning money online and providing them the appropriate steps to become financial independent. Building products and
  launching them for the benefits of mankind fascinates me the most. I also love to inculcate the teachings of Bhagvad Gita in my life and help people do the same.
